How to connect various displays to Arduino or Espressive Controllers

When ever I wanted to connect a display to an ESP or Arduino board, I was bored searching my existing projects or the web for a how-to.
So one day I put all my boards and displays together and started to make this little collection of sketches, with code, libraries to include and description of  hardware connections.
Now it's easy importing code with copy and paste and connecting any display due to the description in the comment.
The compendium is a collection I found searching the internet, many thanks to all the people contributing code for us.
